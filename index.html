                    <p>I dedicated myself, in the last two years, to the challenge of building products based on my ideas, engaging in the responsibility of co-managing a company. I've learned an invaluable lesson about entrepeneurship, tested my design process methods, and questioned myself everyday about how to iterate on product development.

                    <p>I experience Github as a user, but I analyze it as a designer. I see how every part of it has been designed to ease the friction between a highly abstract concept such as version control, and the everyday use that not only programmers make of Github. From forking to publishing, Github is privileging function, making user-centric design a standard.</p>

                    <p>What happens when you want to learn HTML/CSS and Stylus the hard way? What can you do when you're building webapps and tweaking an existing framework seems a counterproductive job? My solution was to build Waffle, the first cannibal (and lightweight) CSS framework based on inline-block. Demo Page and Speakerdeck presentation.</p>

                    <p>The most painful moment in a designer's life is the moment you have to build your online portfolio. Every tool seems unsatisfactory, not fitting your typical workflow. Toying with the idea of hosting a website using Dropbox, me and Vrde decided to spend our spare time developing Isoverse, a publishing platform for visual artists. Working as a Dropbox app, Isoverse makes it possible to directly publishing a website from your computer, working solely with the tools you already know. For Isoverse I worked on visual identity, visual strategy and concept design; UI and guidelines, UX and user flows, HTML (with Django templates) and CSS (vanilla and Stylus), creating both the static site and the portfolio templates we offer. Isoverse is now running on the latest version of Waffle; I've been porting various parts of it from an old version–a valuable experience in reading and rewriting your old code.</p>

                    <p>When with my co-founder we decided to pivot from a social bookmarking platform, we analyzed the data we had on users and content and we realized we indeed attracted mostly programmers. The result is <strong>Devcharm</strong>, a collaborative and open library about programming and development. Even though it fell short on attracting UG content, I worked passionately building the <strong>HTML</strong> using <strong>Django templates</strong>, <strong>UI</strong> elements, guidelines and styles with <strong>Stylus</strong>, along with <strong>interactions and UX</strong>. Devcharm is build upon an early version of Waffle.</p>

                    <p>When I heard a Mozilla Evangelist presenting the Firefox Phone I was suddenly fascinated by the idea of a totally open mobile OS, entirely based on HTML5 and Javascript. I proposed my collaborators to develop a <strong>simple utility app</strong>, for saving and reading links offline–saving bandwith is essential for these entry phones marketed primarily in the developing countries–and in a few days we produced <strong><a href="http://getmanana.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Manana</a></strong>. Here I focused entirely on interactions, users flow and UX, UI and icon design.</p>

                    <p>I still consider myself a typographer, an expert of typography in the context of its use. My MA at the Department of Typography at Reading focused on Book Design, but my research included topics of cognitive psychology and accessibility. Neverthless, one of my favourite projects was designing a series of book covers, in my case I picked a rebranding of sci-fi to elevate the visual approach of the genre; I was very happy when Heyne decided to publish a series of modern and contemporary sci-fi classics using my watercolor illustrations. They changed the typography, but I am still enormously proud to see my design on Neuromancer.</p>
