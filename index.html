Ten years ago I started my professional career as a graphic designer, and one year ago I committed myself to learn frontend coding; I look at how programming is shaping our world and I am excited about the future: social coding is a big part of why all this is happening, and I want to be part of it. <strong>I want to be a product designer at GitHub.</strong></p>

                    <h4>Building a good product</h4>
                    <p>I dedicated myself, in the last two years to my startup, learning an invaluable lesson about entepreneurship, tested my design process methods, and <strong>questioned myself everyday</strong> about <strong>how to iterate on product development</strong>. My startup failed, but I came out stronger in my belief that what is really important for me is building a good product. <strong>I want to be where oustanding products are built, like GitHub.</strong></p>

                <div class="unit reason-why">
                    <h4>In Design, function rules</h4>
                    <p>I experience GitHub as a user, but I analyze it as a designer. I see how every part of it has been designed to <strong>ease the friction</strong> between the <strong>highly abstract concept</strong> that is <strong>version control</strong>, and the everyday use that not only programmers make of GitHub. From forking to publishing, GitHub is privileging function, making user-centric design a standard.</p>

                <div class="unit reason-why">
                    <h4>Because GitHub users love GitHub</h4>
                    <p>Working closely with developers, I heard countless time swearing their love for GitHub. Behind this affection there's the consciousness of the <strong>tangible impact that GitHub has on how they work and collaborate</strong>. I'm eager to learn from the environment and the people that contribute to it. <strong>I want to grow where I know I can make a difference</strong>.</p>

                        <h4>I built communication as a life skill</h4>
                        <p>I started early, in Art school, to realize that explaining a project is as much important as designing it. I was part of a theatre group for almost seven years: all the energies you place on a stage are directed towards passing a message to the audience. With clients, collaborators, team workers and end users, conversation is how you move forward, improving processes and overcoming obstacles. Since I enjoy talking about what I do, I occasionally gave talks here in Berlin. You can the video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anJOAzra-7E" target="_blank">'Designing for Ephemeral Technology'</a>, last year at CoUp.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I have a diverse background, with strong foundation in basic design and typography</h4>
                        <p>I studied as a product &amp; graphic designer, trained as a type designer, worked as a visual designer, and graduated as a book designer. When I started as a webdesigner I knew there was a lot for me to know, but I didn't feel clueless: strong design principles work across disciplines.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I believe in research, and to support design decisions with data</h4>
                        <p>Even when I draw conclusions based on my 'designer's intuition', I am in fact relying on previous experience. There's no such thing as an 'uninformed' decision.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Branding Design made me emphatic</h4>
                        <p>Branding is all about being able to build something original on top a highly structured visual identity, with layers and layers of meaning and graphic solutions stacked upon each other. I grew confident in putting myself in the client's position, knowing that trust can only be win by understanding.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I know how to fall in love with an idea, and when it's time to break up with it</h4>
                        <p>This is surely the biggest lesson my startup time left me with. I previously exercised, as a designer, the need to 'start from scratch' whenever I felt stuck in a project, but I was never as aware as I am now that time means affection; and affection makes it difficult to let go of an idea. I believe in testing as the real hard-proof of design, no matter how much you loved what you were building.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I made HTML/CSS/Git and preprocessing, my design tools</h4>
                        <p>Designing in the browser greatly improved my approach to webdesign; I'm convinced that even though specialization is required to have a deep grasp on a subject, designer today cannot stay away from code. My text editor is my favorite environment, and I'm now in a long term relationship with the terminal.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>My design process: problem–solving comes from establishing procedures</h4>
                        <p>We all stand on the shoulders of giants. I believe this is true in every aspect of work, and life. Nothing can be born out of an empty, blank page. I believe order is essential to achieve effective design solutions. Successful results come from the implementation of good practices; finding a method is as important as solving an immediate problem.</p>

                    <p>What happens when you want to learn HTML/CSS and Stylus the hard way? What can you do when you're building webapps and tweaking an existing framework seems a counterproductive job? If you are me, you'll probably decide to <strong>build your own CSS framework</strong>. This is why I build <strong>Waffle</strong>, the first cannibal (and lightweight) <strong>responsive CSS framework based on inline-block</strong>. No clearing floats, no scary combinations of classes.</p>
                    <p>Compiled in <strong>Stylus</strong>, Waffle is <strong>open source</strong> and released under <strong>MIT Licence</strong>.</p>

                    <p>The most painful moment in a designer's life is the moment you have to build your online portfolio. Every tool seems unsatisfactory, not fitting your typical workflow. Working as a Dropbox app, Isoverse makes it possible to directly publishing a website from your computer, working solely with the tools you already know.</p>
                    <p>I worked on <strong>visual identity and strategy</strong>; UI and guidelines, UX and user flows, HTML (with Django templates) and CSS (vanilla and Stylus), creating both the static site and the portfolio templates we offer. Isoverse is running on the latest version of Waffle; I've been porting various parts of it from an old version–a valuable experience in <strong>reading and rewriting your old code</strong>.</p>

                    <p>When with my co-founder we decided to pivot from a social bookmarking platform, we analyzed the data we had on users and content and we realized we indeed attracted mostly programmers. The result is <strong>Devcharm</strong>, a collaborative and open library about programming and development. Even though it fell short on attracting UG content, I worked passionately building the <strong>HTML</strong> using <strong>Django templates</strong>, <strong>UI</strong> elements, guidelines and styles with <strong>Stylus</strong>, along with <strong>interactions and UX</strong>. Devcharm is build upon an early version of Waffle.</p>
                    <p>I contributed to Devcharm with a first article about <a href="https://devcharm.com/articles/272/understanding-and-fixing-a-detached-head-in-git/" target="_blank"><strong>understanding and fixing a detached head in Git</strong></a>.</p>

                    <p>When I heard a Mozilla Evangelist presenting the Firefox Phone I was suddenly fascinated by the idea of a totally open mobile OS, entirely based on HTML5 and Javascript.</p>
                    <p>I proposed my collaborators to develop a <strong>simple utility app</strong>, for saving and reading links offline–saving bandwith is essential for these entry phones marketed primarily in the developing countries–and in a few days we produced <a href="http://getmanana.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Manana</a>. For this project I focused entirely on interactions, users flow and UX, UI and icon design. You can see mockups and icons in detail <a href="http://scintillaluz.isoverse.us/work/140-manana" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>I still consider myself a <strong>typographer</strong>, an expert of typography in the context of its use. My MA at the Department of Typography at Reading focused on Book Design, but my research included topics of <strong>cognitive psychology</strong> and <strong>accessibility</strong>. Neverthless, one of my favourite projects was designing a series of book covers, in my case I picked a rebranding of sci-fi to elevate the visual approach of the genre.</p>
                    <p>I was very happy when <strong>Heyne decided to publish</strong> a series of modern and contemporary sci-fi classics <strong>using my watercolor illustrations</strong>. They changed the typography, but I am still enormously proud to see my design on Neuromancer.</p>

                    <p>From <strong>content planning</strong> to <strong>micro-typography</strong>, this exercise on book design was a way to practise almost all the skills I've been training for years. I choose the topic, analyzed the market for it, devised in which parts to divide the book and a sequence of chapters; then I worked out <strong>grids</strong>, <strong>typography</strong>, <strong>diagrams</strong>, <strong>illustrations</strong> and <strong>cover design</strong>. I finalized 'The Symbolic Language of Tarot Cards' with a hand bookbinded prototype.</p>
                    <p>As a manual about foretelling with Tarot cards, this book was as much about user interface as graphical arrangement of elements. When I was finished I was asked myself, <strong>why not making a webapp</strong> for reading the future with Tarot Cards? Probably, my next personal project.</p>

Typesetting and layout are simply given, in the eye of the reader; to achieve the result of a 'crystal clear' page, as a typographer I must combine grids and typefaces around the message of the text itself.</p>

But freelancing <strong> lacked continuity</strong>, which I consider crucial for growing.</p>

                            <p>Teaching in an academic environment is an exercise in <strong>balance</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong>, finding a middle ground between your will and the institution's needs. Each student has its own motivation; teaching means understanding individuality, adjusting guidance to it.</p>
