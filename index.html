Ten years ago I started my professional career as a graphic designer, and one year ago I committed myself to learn frontend coding; I look at how programming is shaping our world and I am excited about the future: social coding is a big part of why all this is happening, and I want to be part of it. <strong>I want to be part of Github.</strong></p>

                <h4>Building a good product</h4>
                <p>I dedicated myself, in the last two years, to the challenge of building products based on my ideas, engaging in the responsibility of co-managing a company. I've learned an invaluable lesson about entrepeneurship, tested my design process methods, and questioned myself everyday about how to iterate on product development. If my startup failed, I came out stronger in my believe that what is really important for me is building a good product.</p>

                <h4>In Design, function rules</h4>
                <p>I experience Github as a user, but I analyze it as a designer. I see how every part of it has been designed to ease the friction between a highly abstract concept such as version control, and the everyday use that not only programmers make of Github. From forking to publishing, Github is privileging function, making user-centric design a standard.</p>
