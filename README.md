Hello I am Valentina
=========

Typography, cognitive psychology, accessibility, visual identity, guidelines systems and grids. Ten years ago I started my professional career as a graphic designer, and one year ago I committed myself to learn frontend coding; I look at how programming is shaping our world and I am excited about the future: social coding is a big part of why all this is happening, and I want to be part of it. **I want to be a product designer at GitHub**.
